# Exercism Bootcamp â€“ My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the two-part Exercism Bootcamp, which focuses on foundational programming and front-end web development skills.

## Bootcamp Overview

The bootcamp is divided into two main parts:

1. **Coding Fundamentals**
   - Solved using a pseudocode-style language used for learning language called JikiScript.
   - The language is designed to help beginners learn core programming concepts without worrying about complex syntax.
   - It is in the directory; `coding-fundamentals/`

2. **Frontend Fundamentals**
   - Exercises completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on building interactive and styled web pages and games.
   - It is in the directory; `frontend-fundamentals/`
